    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      When practicing as a lawyer in a field of data protection and IT law,
      I did always do my homework and learn carefully about the technology
      under concern. Soon I ended up in technical meetings, where I could discuss
      data protection directly with architects and engineers. Curious as I am, I
      guess it was just a matter of time till I try to decide software engineering
      myself...

      So here I am today, a lawyer that became a software engineer.

      - role: DevOps Engineer
        time: Aug 2022 - Present
        company: Nortal AS, Tallinn
        details: |
          Currently (since Dec 2022) I have been working in a project that prepares and
          conducts cyber exercises (a company previously known as Talgen).

          Generally, working in different projects means that I have to spend a lot of time 
          consulting architects, product managers and owners about technical
          matters related to operations and information systems.
          
          Moreover, I have to help to plan and manage work related to product
          lifecycle management (e.g. release strategy) and systems engineering
          (e.g. cost reductions, scaling). This includes managing the backlog
          of tasks for system engineers and aligning work with product teams.

          As a result the role is more demanding on the engineering point
          of view since I am expected to know and manage a variety of different
          solutions that would fit the specific needs of the customer.

          
      - role: Software & DevOps Engineer
        time: Oct 2020 - Aug 2022
        company: EveryPay AS, Tallinn
        details: |
          I started working in EveryPay as a full-stack developer.
          My contribution to improve the development environment proved
          my skills as system operations engineer and I was promoted to
          DevOps Engineer position, where I were mainly responsible for 
          improving and maintaining CI/CD and application infrastructure in AWS cloud.

          Over time I was already trusted with additional duties common to senior engineers,
          such as:
           - architecting changes for the infrastructure
           - designing CI/CD and development workflow
           - creating data pipelines
          
          In addition to professional responsibilities, I was a mentor to junior DevOps
          engineer that joined the team in 2022.
